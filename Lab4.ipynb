For example, when a user starts to chat with your chatbot, the conversation will be in the “0” state. In this state, for example, if the user sends a “hi” message, the chatbot can answer something like “tell me a subject you wanted to talk about.” Then, the status of the conversation will change to “1” and the user will send the subject (for example “databases”) and the chatbot will answer something like “ask me a question about this topic.” Then the status of the conversation will go to “2” and the user will send a question, for example, “what is a database?” Then you will use the Wikipedia library to get a piece of Wikipedia text on databases, or any other topic, to act as the context passed to the Hugging Face pipeline. It will apply the “question-answering” task from Hugging Face and thus provide the answer to the user."
